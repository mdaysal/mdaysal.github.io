  <about_me><![CDATA[
    <p> I am an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://www.economics.ku.dk/" target="_blank">Department of Economics</a> at the University of Copenhagen. I am a member of the  <a href="https://www.econ.ku.dk/cebi/" target="_blank">Center for Economic Behavior and Inequality (CEBI)</a>, a Research Fellow at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cesifo.org/en">CESifo</a>, a Research Fellow at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/index_html">IZA</a>, and a Research Fellow at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rfberlin.com/">RFBerlin</a>. I received my B.A. in Economics from Bogazici University in 2003, and my Ph.D. in Economics from University of Maryland, College Park in 2009. </p>
    
    <p> My research fields span health economics and labor economics. I study how health shocks, medical treatments, and social policies interact to shape long-run economic outcomes, family dynamics, and inequality. Thematically, I am particularly interested in early-life health and mental health, family responses to adversity, and the intergenerational transmission of resources and well-being.</p>
    
    <p> I currently serve as an editor at <em><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-health-economics" target="_blank">Journal of Health Economics</a></em> (2025-). </p>
